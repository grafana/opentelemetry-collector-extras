# Extensions

Extensions provide capabilities on top of the primary functionality of the collector. They do not process telemetry data directly but can provide services such as health checking, service discovery, or authentication.

See the [OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#extensions) for more information.
